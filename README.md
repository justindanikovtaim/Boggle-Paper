# Boggle-Paper
Boggle game generator that can be printed out and taken to go

The game is modeled to behave exactly like the real boggle game that I own, with each cube having the exact same letters as the real game.
The eventual goal is to make it optimized for printing so that one could print out as many games as they wanted and play boogle on the go.
